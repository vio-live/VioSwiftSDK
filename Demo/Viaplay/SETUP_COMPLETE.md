# Viaplay Demo - Setup Complete ✅

**Última actualización**: Enero 8, 2026  
**Branch**: `entreteinment-view`  
**Estado**: ✅ SDK configurado + Refactorización completada

This document confirms that the Viaplay demo has been properly configured with Reachu SDK integration and refactored with Atomic Design pattern.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Configuration File Created
**File**: `Viaplay/Configuration/reachu-config.json`

- ✅ Viaplay pink theme (#F5142A)
- ✅ Dark mode configuration
- ✅ API Key configured (same as TV2)
- ✅ Campaign ID: 3 (Tipio integration)
- ✅ Market: Norway (NO/NOK)
- ✅ Features enabled: Live streaming, products, checkout, cart

**Key Differences from TV2**:
```json
{
  "theme": {
    "name": "Viaplay Dark Theme",
    "darkColors": {
      "primary": "#F5142A",  // Viaplay pink (vs TV2 purple #7B5FFF)
      "background": "#1B1B25" // Viaplay dark (vs TV2 #16001A)
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. SDK Components Integrated
**File**: `Viaplay/Components/ViaplayVideoPlayer.swift`

Changes made:
- ✅ Added `import ReachuLiveUI`
- ✅ Added `@StateObject private var campaignManager = CampaignManager.shared`
- ✅ Added `DynamicComponentRenderer()` with z-index 10,000,000
- ✅ Connected to Campaign Manager in `onAppear`
- ✅ Disconnected Campaign Manager in `onDisappear`

**Integration Code**:
```swift
// In ZStack body
DynamicComponentRenderer()
    .zIndex(10_000_000) // Highest z-index

// In onAppear
// CampaignManager.shared initializes automatically with campaignId from config
let campaignId = ReachuConfiguration.shared.liveShowConfiguration.campaignId
print("🎯 [Viaplay] Campaign ID configured: \(campaignId)")

// Reinitialize if needed
if campaignId > 0 && !campaignManager.isConnected {
    Task {
        await campaignManager.initializeCampaign()
    }
}

// In onDisappear
campaignManager.disconnect()
```

### 3. App Initialization Verified
**File**: `Viaplay/ViaplayApp.swift`

- ✅ Already calling `ConfigurationLoader.loadConfiguration()`
- ✅ Enhanced diagnostic logs
- ✅ Prints campaign ID and Tipio URL on startup

**Expected Console Output**:
```
🚀 [Viaplay] Loading Reachu SDK configuration...
✅ [Viaplay] Reachu SDK configured successfully
🎨 [Viaplay] Theme: Viaplay Dark Theme
🎨 [Viaplay] Mode: dark
🔧 [Reachu][Config] environment=development
🔧 [Reachu][Config] graphQLURL=https://stg-dev-microservices.tipioapp.com/graphql
🔧 [Reachu][Config] apiKey=****Q9S
🔧 [Reachu][Market] country=NO currency=NOK
🎯 [Reachu][Campaign] campaignId=3
🎯 [Reachu][Tipio] baseUrl=https://stg-dev-microservices.tipioapp.com
```

### 4. Documentation Added
- ✅ `Configuration/README.md` - Explains configuration details
- ✅ `SETUP_COMPLETE.md` (this file) - Setup verification

## 🎯 How It Works

### Architecture

```
ViaplayApp.swift
├── Loads reachu-config.json via ConfigurationLoader
├── Initializes ReachuConfiguration.shared
└── Provides CartManager & CheckoutDraft to all views

ViaplayVideoPlayer.swift
├── Imports ReachuLiveUI
├── Has CampaignManager.shared
├── Renders DynamicComponentRenderer()
├── Connects to Campaign ID 3 on appear
└── Disconnects on disappear

reachu-config.json
├── Defines Viaplay theme (pink #F5142A)
├── Sets campaignId: 3
└── Configures Tipio WebSocket connection
```

### Component Rendering Flow

1. **App Startup**:
   - `ConfigurationLoader` loads `reachu-config.json`
   - SDK configured with Viaplay theme
   - Campaign ID 3 set in configuration

2. **Video Player Opens**:
   - `ViaplayVideoPlayer` appears
   - `CampaignManager.shared` already initialized with Campaign ID 3
   - If not connected, calls `initializeCampaign()` to connect
   - Connects to Tipio WebSocket: `wss://stg-dev-microservices.tipioapp.com/ws/3`

3. **Component Display**:
   - `DynamicComponentRenderer` listens to `CampaignManager`
   - Campaign components received from Tipio
   - Banners, products, polls, contests rendered automatically
   - Custom overlays (ViaplayPollOverlay, etc.) also work

4. **Video Player Closes**:
   - `CampaignManager.disconnect()` called
   - WebSocket connection closed
   - Resources cleaned up

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### ✅ Configuration Loading
- [ ] Run app in simulator/device
- [ ] Check console for config logs
- [ ] Verify theme name: "Viaplay Dark Theme"
- [ ] Verify campaign ID: 3

### ✅ Video Player Integration
- [ ] Navigate to Sport section
- [ ] Tap on a match (e.g., Barcelona - PSG)
- [ ] Tap "Live" button to open video player
- [ ] Check console for: `🎯 [Viaplay] Connecting to Campaign ID: 3`

### ✅ Campaign Components
- [ ] Video player opens successfully
- [ ] Check console for WebSocket connection logs
- [ ] Components should appear based on campaign schedule
- [ ] Cart icon visible in bottom right

### ✅ SDK Features
- [ ] Floating cart indicator visible
- [ ] Products slider visible on home screen
- [ ] Products slider visible in match detail
- [ ] Checkout overlay opens when tapping cart

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Config Not Loading
**Symptom**: Console shows errors about missing config
**Solution**:
1. Check `reachu-config.json` is in Xcode project
2. Verify it's in "Copy Bundle Resources" (Build Phases)
3. Clean build folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
4. Rebuild project

### Campaign Components Not Showing
**Symptom**: Video player works but no banners/products appear
**Possible causes**:
1. **No active campaign** - Campaign ID 3 might be ended/paused
2. **WebSocket connection failed** - Check network logs
3. **Components not scheduled** - Check campaign configuration in backend

**Debug steps**:
```swift
// In onAppear, add more logging:
Task {
    await campaignManager.loadCampaign(id: campaignId)
    print("🎯 Campaign state: \(campaignManager.campaignState)")
    print("🎯 Is active: \(campaignManager.isCampaignActive)")
    print("🎯 Is connected: \(campaignManager.isConnected)")
}
```

### Custom Overlays vs SDK Components
**Both systems coexist**:
- Custom overlays use `WebSocketManager` (simulated events)
- SDK components use `CampaignManager` (real Tipio events)
- They work independently and can show simultaneously

**To prefer SDK components only**:
- Remove custom WebSocket connection
- Remove custom overlay handling (.onReceive)
- Keep only `DynamicComponentRenderer()`

- Connect to Campaign ID 3 when video player opens
- Display real-time components from Tipio
- Show interactive chat and entertainment components
- Provide a complete e-commerce experience with cart and checkout
- Use clean, maintainable, reusable components

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Run the app** and verify console logs
2. **Test video player** with live campaign
3. **Verify components** render correctly
4. **Test cart** and checkout flow
5. **Compare with TV2** demo for consistency
